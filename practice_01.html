    <p><strong> Mouse is a cartoon character created in 1928 by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks </strong>
    at The Walt Disney Studios, who serves as the mascot of the Walt Disney Company. 
    An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white 
    gloves, Mickey is one of the world's most recognizable fictional characters.</p>

    <br>

    <em>Created as a replacement for a prior Disney character, </em>Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, 
    Mickey first appeared in the short Plane Crazy, debuting publicly in the short film 
    Steamboat Willie (1928), one of the first sound cartoons. He went on to appear in over 
    130 films, including The Band Concert (1935), Brave Little Tailor (1938), and Fantasia 
    (1940). Mickey appeared primarily in short films, but also occasionally in feature-length 
    films. Ten of Mickey's cartoons were nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated 
    Short Film, one of which, Lend a Paw, won the award in 1942. In 1978, Mickey became the 
    first cartoon character to have a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
